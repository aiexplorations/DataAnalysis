# "DataAnalysis" - distributed data generation and summarization functions in Scala

* Simple data analysis library in Scala
* Intent is to distribute computation across multiple cores on a machine
* Distribution-based data generation functions for Gaussian, Lognormal and Weibull distributions
* Classes for variable data analysis and categorical data analysis
* Simple bivariate data analysis functionality being built (correlation available)
* Demonstration area in the "statistics" object

Developed by Rajesh RS ( http://twitter.com/rexplorations / https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeshrs ) as a project to learn Scala programming for data analysis.
